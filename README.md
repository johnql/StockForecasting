# StockForecasting

ABSTRACT: One of the most interesting (or perhaps most profitable) time series to predict are, arguably, stock prices. Accurately predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction â€“ physical factors vs. physiological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.
This work is focused on visualization side using Machine learning techniques to analyses data. Because data need to be cleaned as well as need to make in appropriate quality to visualize effectively. For a layman to make decision on complex stock data based on market sentiment is much easier with visualization. The stock price data at any moment are historical data of a publicly listed company. We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of a choosing 3 stocks as google, bitcoin and gas price future. The core idea behind this article is to showcase how the data value been clearly systematic mapped by using data D3JS visualization and Python graphics to ensure data quality. The Tools: d3.js + Python libraries and Statistical methods.
